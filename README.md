## My process

### Built with

- HTML/CSS

### What I learned

This was a good challenge with testing my CSS skills. I feel pretty confident in HTML and most of CSS. Although, I always have trouble aligning and positioning things with CSS. It was also good practice creating different div containers! Although I created a general .container class. Not sure if it was necessary or not.

```css
.main-container {
    background-color:  hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    border-radius: 30px;
    height: 100%;
    width: 350px;
    filter: drop-shadow(0px 5px 9px #00000052);
    max-width: fit-content;
    margin: 60px auto 10px auto;
}
```

### Continued development

I definitely need more practice with positioning and aligning items in CSS. This was a great challenge for that. And, I look forward to more similar challenges!

At first, the image would go outside of the container when I adjusted the padding and size. But doing the max-width helped!
